    <p>Hi everyone my name is Wade. I was born in China and now I'm living in Auckland New Zealand. </p>
    <p>My major is Applied Technology. I love gaming but I don't have much time these days. </p>
    <p>I like BYU-Idaho because it not only helps me gain more knowledge on my career choice but it also helps me build a stronger relationship with Heavenly Father and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
